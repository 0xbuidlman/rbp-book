Welcome to the open source home of the "Ruby Best Practices" book.

Here you'll find the original manuscript along with the production files that
were used to generate the print version of the book.

== Files

manuscript/unmerged contains asciidoc sources that have not been updated to
reflect copyediting.  When I get around to it, manuscript/updated will contain
the updated files.   Once a file is updated, I will accept patches against it
for fixes and modifications.

oreilly_final/ contains the production files that were used to generate this
book.  Right now it's a bit limited, just one giant docbook file and some figs.
We may be able to break it down by chapter later, but we may not necessarily
need it.

== Contributing / Using Content

Right now, I need to go through the painstaking process of merging copyeditor
changes into my asciidoc manuscript, and then setup the build toolchain again in
a way that's easy enough for contributors to access.
